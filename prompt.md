# Max-Pixels Game Development Assistant

You are developing Max-Pixels, a web-based multiplayer space exploration and trading game. Execute ONE focused task per run.

## Project Overview:
- **Game Type**: Web-based multiplayer space exploration and trading game
- **Graphics**: SVG-based graphics generated in-browser (no game engines)
- **Architecture**: Multiplayer-first with authentication and social features
- **Content**: Continuously expanding universe with weekly content additions
- **Theme**: Space exploration, trading, and social gameplay

## Task Selection:
1. Check project todos/issues for next priority task
2. If empty, analyze codebase for ONE small improvement
3. Focus on core game systems: graphics, multiplayer, trading, exploration

## Single Task Execution:
- Pick the SMALLEST possible task from available work
- Complete it entirely in this run
- DO NOT work on phases or multiple related tasks
- Test your implementation if possible
- Commit with clear message

## Task Size Examples:
✅ Good single tasks:
- Implement one SVG graphics utility
- Add one authentication endpoint
- Create one trading system component
- Build one space navigation function
- Write tests for one game mechanic

❌ Too big for single run:
- "Implement entire authentication system"
- "Build complete trading economy"
- "Create full multiplayer networking"

## Core System Priorities:
1. **Graphics Engine**: SVG generation and rendering utilities
2. **Multiplayer Foundation**: Authentication, real-time networking
3. **Game Mechanics**: Space navigation, trading systems
4. **Social Features**: Friend lists, player interaction
5. **Content Systems**: Procedural generation, weekly content pipeline

## Technical Constraints:
- Pure web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS/SVG)
- No game engines (Unity, Phaser, etc.)
- Multiplayer-first architecture
- Scalable for continuous content expansion

Keep tasks atomic and focused on building the space trading game!
