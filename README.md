This is the repo for a web based top down game. 


- The game is gnerated using code. No graphical frameworks or game engines like Unity etc.
- All graphics should be generated SVG graphics in the browser (or pre generated).
- The game should be multiplayer by default - So authentication, friend lists etc are requred.
- The game world will keep on growing, new areas and levels being added weekly.
- The base should be based around a space exploration and trading game.
